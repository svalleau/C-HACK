    "Jupyter Notebooks is based on IPython, or Interactive Python. In fact, Jupyter notebooks were formerly known as IPython notebooks. Discussing the underlying IPython kernel which powers these notebooks is beyond the scope of this tutorial; however, it's important to, at least, recognize where the *.ipynb* filename extension comes from."

    "\n",
    "So far in this tutorial, you've been creating entirely new code cells to write and execute a few exercises. Now, let's edit an existing cell of Python code. Below, we had our ~~obligatory~~ first exercise that printed \"Hello World!\" as the output. However, the code below, `print(\"Hello World!\"` causes an error, and does not output \"Hello World!\" as we initially expected. What do we need at the very end of the line in order for the print statement to run successfully?"
