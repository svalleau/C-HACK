This includes computer coding, as a light introduction, as well as navigating the Jupyter Notebook environment (the environment you're currently viewing as you're reading this!). We'd like to acknowledge the undergraduate evaluators of this tutorial notebook - thank you Kenny Andre and Dai Nguyen!\n",

    "\n",
    "So far in this tutorial, you've been creating entirely new code cells to write and execute a few exercises. Now, let's edit an existing cell of Python code. Below, we had our ~~obligatory~~ first exercise that printed \"Hello World!\" as the output. However, the code below, `print(\"Hello World!\"` causes an error, and does not output \"Hello World!\" as we initially expected. What do we need at the very end of the line in order for the print statement to run successfully?"
